Beyond Words: Adapting NLP Methodologies for Time Series Forecasting

Welcome to our project repository! This project, a collaboration at Northeastern University, explores the innovative use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies in time series forecasting.

Overview

Our project, "Beyond Words: Adapting NLP Methodologies for Time Series Forecasting," evaluates the potential of NLP models for time series forecasting. We assessed five diverse models, including Autoformer, DLinear, WaveNet, DeepAR, and SimpleFeedForward. WaveNet emerged with superior forecasting performance, highlighting the effectiveness of NLP techniques in time series analysis. Our results underscore the versatility and efficacy of NLP models in detecting complex patterns in time series data. We propose a synergistic combination of attention techniques and further research into sparse-dense attention mechanisms, opening new avenues for advanced and flexible time series forecasting techniques.
